# Project description and plan

## Motivation

Trying to understand someone else's code&mdash;especially
at a large scale&mdash;can be an intimidating, difficult, and overwhelming task:
having to distinguish keywords and follow control flow in raw source code can be tiring,
even if the code is well-commented. Documentation can ease this process,
but text alone isn't always the best or most accessible way to express an idea.
_Codeviz_&mdash;short for "Code Visualizer"&mdash;addresses this problem
by translating code to flowcharts, which offer a more visually- and spatially-appealing
representation of code; normally code-based algorithms are expressed in 1D,
but with flowcharts, these algorithms can be expressed in 2D.
_Codeviz_ strives to provide tools for making simpler and more accessible documentation,
but does not replace the need for more traditional, text-based documentation.
Not only would this solution help anyone (i.e., programmers and non-programmers alike)
in understanding code, but it could also reduce the effort necessary to produce 'good' documentation
since, ideally, programmers wouldn't have to venture too far from the code itself
to generate the flowcharts. Perhap optimistically, the language will also
compel programmers to write more high level, commented, and documented code
because doing so would be a sort of requirement of the language.
Another really cool potential result would be that programmers could use skeleton code
in the language in which they intend to work to generate complete flowcharts
that express the entirety of the intended algorithm.
