# Project description and plan

## Motivation

Trying to understand someone else's code&mdash;especially
at a large scale&mdash;can be an intimidating, difficult, and overwhelming task:
having to distinguish keywords and follow control flow in raw source code can be tiring,
even if the code is well-commented. Documentation can ease this process,
but the norm for documentation is text-based, which isn't always
the best or most accessible way to express an idea;
and there aren't many popular tools for making documentation that _is_ more accessible.

_Codeviz_&mdash;short for "Code Visualizer"&mdash;addresses this problem
by providing a language that makes it easier for programmers to create flowcharts
that represent the control flow of their code,
offering a more visually- and spatially-appealing representation of code:
normally code-based algorithms are expressed in 1D,
but with flowcharts, these algorithms can be expressed in 2D.

Not only would this solution help anyone (i.e., programmers and non-programmers alike)
in understanding code, but it also reduces the effort necessary to produce 'good' documentation:
a _Codeviz_ program shows up as syntax in an established GPL,
so programmers don't have to venture too far from the code itself to generate the flowcharts.
It's primarily for this reason, and the fact that programmers might not want
every implementation detail to leak into the flowcharts&mdash;such that
there should be some way to indicate what _should_ appear on the flowcharts&mdash;that
a DSL is an appropriate vehicle for this solution.
Perhaps optimistically, the language will also compel programmers
to write more high level, commented, and documented code
because doing so is a sort of requirement of the language.
