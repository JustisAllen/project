# Project description and plan

## Motivation

Trying to understand someone else's code&mdash;especially
at a large scale&mdash;can be an intimidating, difficult, and overwhelming task,
even if the person trying to digest the code is an experienced programmer:
having to distinguish keywords and follow control flow in raw source code can be tiring,
even if the code is well-commented. Documentation can help this process,
but text alone isn't always the best or most accessible way to express an idea.
_Codeviz_&mdash;short for "Code Visualizer"&mdash; addresses this problem
by mapping code to flowcharts, which offer a more visually- and spatially-appealing
representation of code&mdash;but would not replace the need for more traditional text-based documentation. Not only would this solution help anyone (i.e., programmers and non-programmers alike) in understanding code, but it could also reduce the effort necessary to produce 'good' documentation since, ideally, programmers wouldn't have to venture too far from the code itself to generate the flowcharts. Perhap optimistically, the language could also compel programmers to write more high level, commented, and documented code because doing so would be a sort of requirement of the language. Another really cool potential result would be that programmers could use skeleton code in the language in which they intend to work to generate complete flowcharts that express the entirety of the intended algorithm.
