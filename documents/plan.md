# Project plan

## Language evaluation

I'll deem [Codeviz] a success if users can generate simple,
`if`-`else`-based flowcharts without much effort. To evaluate the language _design_,
I'll consider ease of use in the underlying language,
in particular I plan to use the language to generate flowcharts
for solutions to CS 5 or 60 assignments.
To ensure that language _implementation_ is of high quality,
I'll consider how easy it is for other programmers to adapt other programming languages
or flowchart creators to my flowchart abstract syntax.

Critiques will also help with both design and implementation quality. :relaxed:
